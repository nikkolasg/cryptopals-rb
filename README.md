# cryptopals-rb

Follow up of cryptopals-rs but in ruby. It starts at set 2 challenge 12.
The reason behind it is that after the first few challenges, I knew already all the rust code that I will be using. I don't learn that much all the nice features of that language because (shamefully) I don't try to make them nice, simply to make them work: define `fn` after `fn` and that's it.
Since my goal is to finish these challenges, I prefer doing them in Ruby. I'll go back to Rust with a real project.
